Base64 Fold
===========

Base64-encoded Data URIs are notoriously long and look ugly in text editors:

Since you never edit these embeds, they are just sitting there, wasting space and irritating you by going beyond your screen width or wrapping to many lines.
This little plug-in makes use of Sublime Text folding to hide them:

Problem solved: the URI is still there, but it's neatly folded and can be unfolded for inspection.

Don't forget about these default Sublime key shortcuts:

Fold:   ```ctrl+shift+]``` 

Unfold: ```ctrl+shift+[```
